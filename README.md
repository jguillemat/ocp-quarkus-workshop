# Architecture Workshop - Kubernetes Native
## What is it
The *Architecture Workshop - Kubernetes Native* is a two-days learning experience for developers who want to understand and make use of the benefits of Quarkus in an OpenShift environment in their daily work. They learn everything they need to understand the concepts, the architectural principles and components of Quarkus and OpenShift and related products for successfully discussing and developing Cloud Native Applications at a customer site from a developerâ€™s perspective.

## Key takeaways
- Benefits of using Quarkus
- Concepts of Quarkus
- Basic understanding
- Making use of Quarkus Dev Services
- Understanding and using Quarkus to build a micro service
- Developing Quarkus Apps with OpenShift 
  - Using Source to Image
  - Understanding Serverless (Knative)
  - Deployment of Quarkus apps on OpenShift
- Using and understanding of Kustomize and Helm Charts
- Use OpenShift Pipelines (Tekton Pipelines) to do CI/CD
- Use of ArgoCD and OpenShift GitOps

## Format
The workshop is designed as a two-days experience with a mix of presentations and quite a lot of demos.

To make it more enjoyable for everyone, we are going to implement a multiplayer game (Pac-Man / FatCat inspired) with an already existing JavaScript client and a server part, written with Quarkus. 

Have a look at [GitHub](https://github.com/wpernath/quarkus-grumpycat) to see a demo of the game.
